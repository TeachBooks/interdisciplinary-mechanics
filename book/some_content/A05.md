# Assignment 5

## Introduction
This assignment aims to apply the "wave-based" methods to solve some classical river and traffic flows problems. All required methodological backgrounds can be found in the slides of lectures 14, 15.


## Section 1: The "Fancy" race
We are going to organize a race between cars and water in a river. At time $t <0$, both flows are packed between $x = -200 \mathrm{m}$ and $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$ and hold by gates/traffic signals. We remove the gates and turn traffic signals into green at time $t = 0$. Let's see what is happening!

Initial boundary conditions for the "fancy" race. (a) traffic flow (b) river flow.
```

{numref}`Figure {number} <A5_Figure_1>` represents the initial boundary conditions for both traffic (1a) and river (1b) flows. They define two Riemann problems at location $x = -200 \mathrm{m}$ and $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$. We are going to first focus on the front of the race, i.e., the Riemann problem at $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$. Our first objective is to draw the space-time diagram in both cases. {numref}`Figure {number} <A2_Figure_2` provides the fundamental diagram of the traffic flow.

## Question 1
The fundamental diagram in {numref}`Figure {number} <A2_Figure_2` is quadratic in free-flow and linear in congestion. The equations are

$$ 
\begin{align}
Q(\rho) &= a \rho^2 + b\rho \quad &&\text{in free-flow} \\
Q(\rho) &= w(\rho_{max} - \rho) \quad &&\text{in congestion}
\end{align}
$$ 

### Question 1a
````{admonition} Model answer
:class: dropdown

$w$ is the slope of the line in congestion modus.

$$ w = \frac{q_{max} - 0}{\rho_{max} - \rho_c} = \frac{0.6}{0.02 - 0.05} = 4 \mathrm{m/s}
````

### Question 1b

````{admonition} Model answer
:class: dropdown
To find the value of $a$, 
$Q(\rho_c) = a \rho_c^2 + b\rho_c = q_{max}$
$a = \frac{q_{max} - v_{max}\rho_c}{\rho_c^2}= -20 \mathrm{m/s}$

To find the value of $b$, 
$Q'(0) = 2a \cdot 0 + b = v_{max}
