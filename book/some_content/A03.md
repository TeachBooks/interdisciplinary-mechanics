# Assignment 3

## Introduction

Tidal wave propagation over long channels is a fundamental phenomenon in rivers and estuaries around the world. The flow velocity induced by the flood and ebb can have a detriment effect on navigation. These same flow velocities influence morphological time scales as well as water quality. The water level amplitudes along the channel influences flood risk calculations. In fact, the methods of the present assignment were developed and used by a committee headed by H.A. Lorentz to ensure that the closure of the Zuiderzee would not have detrimental effects on the rest of the Wadden sea coast. The following footage captures the situation before the construction.
