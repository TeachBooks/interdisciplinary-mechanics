# Assignment 3

## Introduction

Tidal wave propagation over long channels is a fundamental phenomenon in rivers and estuaries around the world. The flow velocity induced by the flood and ebb can have a detriment effect on navigation. These same flow velocities influence morphological time scales as well as water quality. The water level amplitudes along the channel influences flood risk calculations. In fact, the methods of the present assignment were developed and used by a committee headed by H.A. Lorentz to ensure that the closure of the Zuiderzee would not have detrimental effects on the rest of the Wadden sea coast. The following footage captures the situation before the construction.

## Question 1

A tide propagating over a very long channel is a progressive/propagating wave that can be represented as a harmonic wave $\zeta(s,t)=\overline{\zeta}(s)\cos{(\omega t-ks+\alpha)}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency, $k$ the (real-valued) wave number and $\alpha$ the initial phase. $\overline{\zeta}(s)$ is the surface perturbation amplitude that varies spatially along the channel.

Consider a progressive wave in a 7-m depth channel with an amplitude $\overline{\zeta}(s=0)=1.1\,\mathrm{m}$, an initial phase $\alpha=0\,\mathrm{rad}$ and a length $L=200\,\mathrm{km}$. In absence of damping/resistance the amplitude remains constant along the channel.

The water level $h$ equals the mean level (constant in time and space) plus the perturbation $\zeta$.

$$
h(s=100\,\mathrm{km},t=0\,\mathrm{s})=h_0+\zeta(s=100\,\mathrm{km},t=0\,\mathrm{s})=7-1.1=5.9\,\mathrm{m}

The length of a periodic wave in radians is $2\pi$, which means that the distance between the maximum and minimum values is half of the wave length: $\pi$.

Have a look at the unit. The exponent has to be non-dimensional. Therefore the units of $\mu$ need to be the inverse ones of $s$.

## Question 6

The surface perturbation can be expressed as the real part of a complex expression:
$\zeta(s,t)=\overline{\zeta}(0)e^{-\mu s}\cos{(\omega t-ks+\alpha)}=\operatorname{Re}\left(\overline{\zeta}(0)e^{-\mu s}e^{i(\omega t-ks+\alpha)}\right)$
which can be divided in space and time components: $\zeta(s,t)=\operatorname{Re}\left(\overline{\zeta}(0)e^{-\mu s+i(-ks+\alpha)}e^{i\omega t}\right)=\operatorname{Re}\left(\overline{\zeta}(s)e^{i\omega t}\right)$ where $\overline{\zeta}(s)$ is the complex amplitude.

The complex amplitude has a real and imaginary part, its length represents the amplitude $\overline{\zeta}(s)$ and its angle represents the phase.

## Question 7

A hodograph is a graphical representation in the complex plane of the complex ampitude $\tilde{\zeta}(s)=\hat{\zeta}(0)e^{-\mu s+i(-ks+\alpha)}=\tilde{\zeta}(0)e^{-(\mu+ik)s}$

The length of the complex amplitude vector of an hodograph characterized by a circle is constant at any phase, so it does not experience damping. The spiral exhibits damping behaviour.

## Question 10

Evaluate the relevance of each term of the general momentum equation for 1D long waves,

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial V^2}{\partial s}+g\frac{\partial h}{\partial s}+\frac{c_f|V|V}{h}=0
$$

for a typical situation of a tide propagating into an estuary. Consider an estuary with a depth of 20 m and a tide with a length of 600 km, wave height of 1 m, a period of 12h 25 min and a characteristic flow velocity of 0.6m/s, the resistance coefficient cf is equal to 0.004.

Select which statement described the importance of the term in this situation the best:

## Question 11

For a tidal wave entering an estuary, river or channel, the second term of the momentum equation can be neglected, having as governing equations the following balances:

$$
B\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial s}=0\\
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+gA_c\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial s}+c_f\frac{|Q|Q}{A_cR}=0
$$

Note that $h$ has been changed to $\zeta$. This transformation is possible because $h(s,t)=h_o+\zeta(s,t)$, where $h_o$​ is the mean water level and $\zeta$ is the fluctuation around this value. The resistance term can be replaced by a linearized term:

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+gA_c\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial s}+\Phi Q=0
$$

This principle states that the dissipation by the linearized friction term during a tidal cycle should be equal to the dissipation by the original quadratic friction during a tidal cycle:

$$
\Phi=\frac{8}{3\pi}c_f\frac{\hat{Q}}{A_cR}
$$

Be aware that $\hat{Q}$ is in fact a guess of the maximum discharge expected and will be assumed as a known value. However, rigorously speaking, the value of $\hat{Q}$​ should be iterated until reaching convergence.

````{admonition} Model answer
:class: dropdown
The derivation of the continuity equation respect to time is $B\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial s}=0\,(15.1)$ and the derivation of the momentum equation with respect to space is $\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+gA_c\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial s}+\Psi\frac{\partial}{\partial s}Q=0\,(15.2)$. The third term of 15.2 can be rewritten using the continuity equation $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial s}=-B\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial t}$. So $\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+gA_c\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial s}-B\Psi\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial t}=0\,(15.3)$.

And both equations can be combined by substracting 15.3 from 15.1:

$B\frac{\partial^2\zeta}{\partial t^2}-gA_c\frac{\partial^2\zeta}{\partial s^2}+B\Psi\frac{\partial\zeta}{\partial t}=0$. Finally the result is obtained by dividing it by the storage width.
