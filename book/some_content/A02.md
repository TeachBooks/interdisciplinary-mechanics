# Assignment 2

## Introduction

In this assignment non-dispersive wave propagation and reflection/transmission of waves in a foundation pile, which is modelled as a bar (Figure 1), are considered. The theory was discussed in Lecture Topic 3 (model for the bar) and in Lecture Topic 8 (non-dispersive waves in an open channel).

The 1-D wave equation describes the wave propagation in the bar:
$$\rho A \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial t^2} - EA \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} = 0$$

Here, $\rho$, $E$, $A$ denotes the mass density, the Young's modulus and the cross-sectional area of the pile, respectively while $u_x$ denotes the longitudinal displacement.

Since for the bar the double plane stress assumption was made (this is always the case if we have a bar), the stresses on the y face (as well as on the z face) are zero. Hence, answer "zero" is the correct one.

````{admonition} Model answer
:class: dropdown
We use the plane stress constitutive equations from Topic 3, so
$$\begin{bmatrix}
        \varepsilon_{xx}\\
        \varepsilon_{zz}\\
        \varepsilon_{zx}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =\frac{1}{E}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1       &-\nu   &0      \\
        -\nu    &1      &0      \\
        0       &0      &1+\nu  
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \sigma_{xx}\\
        \sigma_{zz}\\
        \sigma_{zx}
    \end{bmatrix}\\$$

Because of the double plane stress assumption, there is only uni-axial stress, so only axially loaded. Therefore, 
$$\sigma_{zz} = 0$$

For the longitudinal strain in $z$ direction we can therefore write
$$\varepsilon_{zz} = -frac{\nu}{E}\simga_{xx}

Clearly, due the Poissonâ€™s effect, the strains in out of plane directions are non-zero.
