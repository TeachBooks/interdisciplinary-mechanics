# Assignment 2

## Introduction

In this assignment non-dispersive wave propagation and reflection/transmission of waves in a foundation pile, which is modelled as a bar (Figure 1), are considered. The theory was discussed in Lecture Topic 3 (model for the bar) and in Lecture Topic 8 (non-dispersive waves in an open channel).

The 1-D wave equation describes the wave propagation in the bar:
$\rho A \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial t^2} - EA \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} = 0$

Here, $\rho$, $E$, $A$ denotes the mass density, the Young's modulus and the cross-sectional area of the pile, respectively while $u_x$ denotes the longitudinal displacement.

Since for the bar the double plane stress assumption was made (this is always the case if we have a bar), the stresses on the y face (as well as on the z face) are zero. Hence, answer "zero" is the correct one.

````{admonition} Model answer
:class: dropdown
We use the plane stress constitutive equations from Topic 3, so
$\begin{bmatrix}
        \varepsilon_{xx}\\
        \varepsilon_{zz}\\
        \varepsilon_{zx}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =\frac{1}{E}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1       &-\nu   &0      \\
        -\nu    &1      &0      \\
        0       &0      &1+\nu  
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \sigma_{xx}\\
        \sigma_{zz}\\
        \sigma_{zx}
    \end{bmatrix}\\$

Because of the double plane stress assumption, there is only uni-axial stress, so only axially loaded. Therefore, $\sigma_{zz} = 0$

For the longitudinal strain in $z$ direction we can therefore write
$\varepsilon_{zz} = -frac{\nu}{E}\simga_{xx}$

Clearly, due the Poisson’s effect, the strains in out of plane directions are non-zero.

````{admonition} Model answer
Look at and keep in mind that:
$\begin{bmatrix}
        \varepsilon_{xx}\\
        \varepsilon_{zz}\\
        \varepsilon_{zx}
    \end{bmatrix}
    =\frac{1}{E}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1       &-\nu   &0      \\
        -\nu    &1      &0      \\
        0       &0      &1+\nu  
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \sigma_{xx}\\
        \sigma_{zz}\\
        \sigma_{zx}
    \end{bmatrix}\\$

​
$\sigma_{xx} = E\varepsilon{xx}$  expresses the correct stress-strain relation for the case of double plane stress (“uni-axial stress”). 

​$\sigma_{xx} = \frac{E}{1- \nu^2} \varepsilon{xx}$ would be the right stress-strain relation for the case of plane stress and plain strain combined (i.e., for the diaphragm wall; see Lecture 3), and ​$\sigma_{xx} = \frac{(1-\nu) E}{(1+\nu)(1- 2\nu)} \varepsilon{xx}$ would be the right stress-strain relation for the case of double plain strain (“uni-axial strain”; see Assignment 1).

## Solution to the 1-D problem of a Semi-infinite bar
We consider the semi-infinite rod shown in Figure 1, which has free end at $x=0$
The transient excitation (hammer blow) is represented in the following simplified manner:
$ F(t) = F_0, \quad 0<t<t_0$
$ F(t) = 0, \quad t>t_0$
where $t_0 = \frac{L}{4c}$ (i.e., the duration of the pulse is one quarter of the time it takes for a wave to propagate through the entire bar). We assume that the bar is initially at rest.

The general solution of Eq. 1 can be written as follows (D’Alembert’s solution):
$u_x = u_x^+ \left(t - \frac{x}{c}\right) + u_x \left(t + \frac{x}{c}\right)$
where, $u_x^+$ denotes a wave propagating in positive direction, and $u_x^-$ in negative direction. Note that we are using the arguments $t - \frac{x}{c}$ and $t + \frac{x}{c}$ instead of $x+ct$ and $x-ct$, respectively (see also Topic 8). This is convenient when dealing with non-homogeneous boundary conditions.
