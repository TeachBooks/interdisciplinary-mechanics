# Assignment 1

## Introduction
In this assignment, we consider the behaviour of a soil layer which is subject to loading applied at the top. As shown in Figure 1, the load consists of a (temporary) soil body of very large size (in x and y directions), which allows to assume that there is no change in loading conditions in the horizontal directions, and neither in the response. Therefore, a 1‚Äêdimensional model will suffice to predict the response of the soil layer, with only the z direction represented.
