# Section 1: The "Fancy" race
We are going to organize a race between cars and water in a river. At time $t <0$, both flows are packed between $x = -200 \mathrm{m}$ and $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$ and hold by gates/traffic signals. We remove the gates and turn traffic signals into green at time $t = 0$. Let's see what is happening!

Initial boundary conditions for the "fancy" race. (a) traffic flow (b) river flow.
```

{numref}`Figure {number} <A5_Figure_1>` represents the initial boundary conditions for both traffic (a) and river (b) flows. They define two Riemann problems at location $x = -200 \mathrm{m}$ and $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$. We are going to first focus on the front of the race, i.e., the Riemann problem at $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$. Our first objective is to draw the space-time diagram in both cases. {numref}`Figure {number} <A5_Figure_2>` provides the fundamental diagram of the traffic flow.

## Question 1
The fundamental diagram in {numref}`Figure {number} <A5_Figure_2>` is quadratic in free-flow and linear in congestion. The equations are

$$ 
\begin{align}
Q(\rho) &= a \rho^2 + b\rho \quad &&\text{in free-flow} \\
Q(\rho) &= w(\rho_{max} - \rho) \quad &&\text{in congestion}
\end{align}
$$

The speed is the slope of the $q$-$\rho$ diagram. Have a look at the first part.

The steepest part of the curve is when $\rho = 0$ and the most gentle part when $\rho = \rho_c$. The fastest kinematic wave speed is $13 \mathrm{m/s}$ ($v_{max}$).
The slowest kinematic wave speed is 
$Q'(\rho_c) = 2 a \rho_c + v_{max} = 11 \mathrm{m/s}$

We look for the kinematic wave starting at $x = 0$ at $t = 0$ and reaching $x = 200$ at $t$. The slope of this kinematic wave is $Q'(\rho)$ but also $\frac{x}{t}$.

So, 

$$2a\rho + v_{max} = \frac{x}{t}$$

Hence, 

$$\rho = \frac{\frac{x}{t} - v_{max}}{2a}$$

The conservation principle makes the calculation straightforward as we have

$$ T = \frac{1 + k_c x}{q_{max}} = 18.33 > t_2 $$

## Question 6
Draw now the space-time diagram corresponding to the Riemann problem at $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$ for the river flow. Please refer to the non-linear solution method in lecture 15. Remember that a python code has been provided to automatically determine the state diagram, so you only have to draw the space-time diagram. Do not use the linear approximation here, as the initial conidition is too sharp.

For a rarefaction wave, wave speeds are defined by $\lambda_1(U)$ where, $U$ is between the two boundary states (here $U_{l}$ and $U_m$). The kinematic wave speeds are $\lambda(U_l)$ and $\lambda(U_m)$ with $\lambda = V - \sqrt{gd}$.

For a shockwave, the speed is given by the Rankine-Hugoniot condition, which depends on the two boundary states (here $U_m$ and $U_r$).

This wave is a shockwave, whose speed is

A linear diagram is free-flow with a free-flow speed equal to $4.1 \mathrm{m/s}$. Because the front wave in water is a single wave. The only way to get that with the traffic is that the fan collapses into a signgle contact wave, which can only happen in the fundamental diagram in linear in free-flow.

With the linearization, the state diagram is a simple triangle, whose base is $(0, 0)$, $(d_0, 0)$. The height of this triangle represents the speed at $U_m$, which is also the speed of the shockwave in that particular case as the downstream state is $(0, 0)$. The slope of the triangle is $\sqrt{\frac{2d}{d_0}}$. 

In this end, we want that :

$$
\sqrt{\frac{2g}{d_0}} \cdot \frac{d_0}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{gd_0}{2}} > 13 = v_{max, traffic}
$$

It happens when $d_0 > 34.34 \mathrm{m}$. Note that when you check with the non-linear state diagram, the value is different close to $18 \mathrm{m}$ because it is clear that non-linear effect matters here.

Because the eigenvalues of the river flow problem are symmetric when $V = 0 (\lambda = \pm \sqrt{gh})$, the solutions are also symmetric if the initial condition is. So, it suffices to reverse the solution of the front Riemann problem to derive the rear Riemann problem.

It is when the contact wave propagating backward from $x = 0$ (see the solution of the front Riemann problem in Q2) meets the steady shockwave of the rear Riemann problem. The first wave starts at $x = 0, t = 0$ with a speed $-4 \mathrm{m/s}$ (see {numref}`Figure {number} <A5_Figure_2>` and question Q1) and the second from $x = -200$ at $t = 0$, with a speed equal to $0$.

There are two boundary waves starting at $x = 0 \mathrm{m}$ and $x = -200 \mathrm{m}$ have a speed equal to $-4.4$ and $4.4 \mathrm{m/s}$ respectively. So, they meet at time $22.7 \mathrm{s}$. It is worth noticing that the initial state disappears quicker in the river (water is less "stable" than a compact car platoon!)
